//You might be wondering why we donâ€™t simply create an instance of the Prisma Client whenever we need it. Well, while that approach works, it leads to creating a new database connection for every interaction.
// This can be inefficient and resource-intensive. In contrast, by creating a singleton instance of the Prisma Client, we establish a single connection that is reused throughout the application. This optimizes performance, minimizes overhead, and ensures consistent and efficient database operations.
